I created a web application for shopping lists management. The application allows creating shopping lists and adding items  to these lists, as well as deleting lists or collecting items. Users can check the number of created shopping lists and the number of created items. You can try out the application at https://shopping-list-youssef-haidala.herokuapp.com/

The application use a three-tier architecture (client, server, database) and a layered architecture with four layers (views, controllers, services, database).

technologies : deno(javascript framework), postgresql, heroku.
